## How it works
This chess game was created with the Python module pygame, which creates a graphical interface for the game. The chess piece icons for this program were created by smalllikeart on Flaticon and modified slightly for the purposes of this game. The color designs are original.

## How to play
The program requires importing the pygame module and the sys module. 

The game is played with only the mouse. When it is the player's turn, clicking on a chess piece on the board will select it, and the player can then click on any available location to move the piece there or capture an enemy piece as long as it is a valid move for the piece type. After the player's turn is completed, it becomes the opponent's turn; the game alternates turns between the players until a checkmate condition has been reached and the game concludes.
